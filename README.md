## How to play the game? 
Enter any number between 1 and 20 into the grid in the bottom left corner, then click the 'Check!' button beneath the grid. The background colour of the game will change to light green from dark gray once the player enters the correct guess. 


Each wrong guess will see the player's score dropping. Meanwhile, the player's highest score throughout the game will be displayed as well.
